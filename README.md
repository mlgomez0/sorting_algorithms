#sorting_algorithms.
Concepts reviewed.
- Different sorting algorithms
-What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
-How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
-What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Installation

The programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic file.c main.c -o exec_name.

```bash
./ exec_name
```

## Usage

Educational purposes

## Tasks
n-O: where n is from 0 to 2 , it is the time complexity of the respective algorithm (best case, average case, worst case)
0. -bubble_sort.c: Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm(0-O : time complexity)
1. -insertion_sort_list.c:Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm(1-O: time complexity).
2. -selection_sort.c: Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm (2-0: time complexity).
3. quick_sort.c: Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm (3-0 time complexity)
